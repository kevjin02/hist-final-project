        name: <h1>Apollo 11</h1>,
        details: <p>On July 20th, 1969, with over half a billion people watching back home on their television, Neil Armstrong became the first to step foot on the moon. His famous words, “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” would bring the end to the “Space Race” and usher in a new era of exploring the impossible.
        <br/>Space has and will continue to capture the imaginations of anyone who looks up at the starry night. The landing on the moon was NASA’s greatest achievement at the time and made it possible for us to consider possibilities like colonizing Mars. It has also been crucial for international relations. The Apollo-Soyuz mission, carried out jointly by Russia and the United States, was an important milestone in easing Cold War tensions. And of course, the International Space Station has allowed astronomers around the world to work together and make advancements no single country could achieve alone.

        name: <h1>John Harrison’s H4</h1>,
        details: <p>In 1714, The Longitude Act was signed by the British parliament, providing a huge reward to anyone who could determine a method to find a ship’s precise longitude at sea.
        <br/>One of the contenders for this prize was John Harrison, a self-taught clockmaker who journeyed to London in hopes of creating a more accurate way to tell time, and thus use that time to determine a ship’s longitude. Over 20 years later, Harrison came up with the H1, which showed great promise in its trials. Harrison, however, was displeased with his work, and would later go on to develop the H2 and H3, each more precise than the one before.
        <br/>In the 1750s, Harrison came up with the H4, a large pocket watch that was capable of being used in the sea. H4 was revolutionary in that no pocket watch was ever considered to be an accurate means of measuring time back then.
        <br/>Harrison, however, met much opposition throughout his work. The Commissioners in charge of the prize money were skeptical that a self-taught clockmaker who was a carpenter by trade could come up with such a masterpiece well ahead of their time. He also faced a lot of competition from astronomers, who were working to develop their own method of determining longitude by using the stars. Harrison was able to overcome these barriers, however, and would become a source of inspiration for many who wanted to delve into the sciences.

        name: <h1>Enola Gay</h1>,
        details: <p>On August 6th, 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. These bombs would usher in the end of World War II, but also bring about a new era of fear over the implications of developing such powerful weapons.
        <br/>Indeed, the likes of Einstein felt deep regret for their contributions to the theory and technology needed to build such a powerful weapon. It provided an example of when a need for scientific advancement was desired without deep thought into its social implications as seen later on. The atomic bomb would lead to a need of rapid advancement by both the Soviet Union and the United States, in which each poured countless resources into stockpiling hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles, and lead to many small proxy wars over the great question of democracy vs. communism.

The observatory highlights the importance of astronomy at the time, as well as how science became a source of pride for many countries. Formations of such organizations as the Academy of Sciences directly under royal patronage was a way for nations to demonstrate their superiority and create a lasting legacy by sealing their names in science. </p>,

        name: <h1>Einstein’s Streetcar</h1>,
        details: <p>Einstein and many theoretical physicists were famous for their thought experiments. In one case, Einstein, while observing a clock tower in Bern, wondered how it would appear if he was in a streetcar, moving away from the clock tower at the speed of light. He realized that in the speeding streetcar, he would see that time would have stopped on the clock. This realization became an important factor in his paper on a “special theory of relativity.” He believed that space-time could be affected by mass, energy, and gravity. These realizations have helped scientists better understand how the celestial bodies of the universe interact with each other, as well as contribute to the nuclear age.</p>,

Created against his will by a scientist obsessed with creating life without understanding its implications, the monster is subsequently abused for its terrifying appearance and never knows how to love. As a product of the environment around him, he seeks to show Dr. Frankenstein his anguish after Dr. Frankenstein refuses to create a female counterpart.<br></br>Shelley was an author in the Romantic era, a period of time in which many thought of nature and science as mysterious and fantastical, and raised human concerns to the sciences in hopes to better understand its potential impacts on society.</p>,

        name: <h1>Snow's <i>Two Cultures</i></h1>,
        details: <p>C.P. Snow, a novelist and chemist, was most notable for his piece <i>The Two Cultures</i>. In it, he describes the growing divide between science and the humanities within British higher education. His observations about these behaviours, however, have sparked conversation over how science and the humanities are taught throughout the world.
        <br/>Snow shows how the two “cultures” are divided in various ways. He observes how those who know the principles of, say, Newton’s Laws of Thermodynamics, would never have picked up a work of Shakespeare’s, and vice versa. These differences have major implications for society, in which science plays such an important role that its ethics and purpose must be discussed before major contributions are made without much thought towards their possibly lasting effects.

        <br/>This work was highly controversial in many ways. Many scientists were appalled by how open Watson was about the going-ons of scientific research, and even more were surprised at his continued negativity and sexism towards Rosiland Franklin, a very notable scientist in the field who was the first to propose a helical structure, and whose work greatly contributed to Watson and Crick’s discovery.

        details: <p>Darwin’s famed expeditions aboard the HMS <i>Beagle</i> brought him experience of nature firsthand that would contribute to his theory of natural selection. Darwin believed that species adapted over time based on their needs, and proposed relationships between different species and looked for common ancestors. 
        <br/>These theories were met by a mixed reception in the scientific community. Some scientists regarded his work as unscientific or insignificant, questioning the evidence he provides and the insufficient conclusions drawn from them. Others, however, were eager to accept his ideas and made great contributions to our understanding of animal behavior that have made biology such an important subject for society today.

        <br/>His most famous work was the Principia, in which he provided his theories of the universe and physics, basing them off of logical reasoning and observation. He believed that theories must be built on observation, and can also only be disproven by concrete evidence. </p>,

        name: <h1>The FLAVR SAVR Tomato</h1>,
        details: <p>One of the biggest advancements of science within the food industry came on May 21st, 1994 with the introduction of the FLAVR SAVR tomato. This tomato was the first ever genetically engineered crop to hit the market, and was designed so that it would maintain its ripeness well after the normal tomato and this gave it a much longer shelf and shipping life. 
        <br/>These tomatoes, along with subsequent genetically-engineered crops, were still met by a lot of opposition. One of the most notable shifts in attitude came in August 1998, when Dr. Arpad Pusztai said that it is possible that feeding rats genetically modified potatoes could lead to health effects that were a result of genetic engineering. Despite it being proven that the FLAVR SAVR tomato was similar to regular tomatoes in every way except that its cell walls degraded more slowly, there grew a general stigma against genetically engineered crops that still stands to this day.
