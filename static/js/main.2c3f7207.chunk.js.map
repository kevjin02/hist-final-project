His famous words, “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” \n                 would bring the end to the “Space Race” and usher in a new era of exploring \n                 the impossible.\n                <br/>Space has and will continue to capture the imaginations of anyone who \n                looks up at the starry night. The landing on the moon was NASA’s greatest \n                achievement at the time and made it possible for us to consider possibilities \n                like colonizing Mars. It has also been crucial for international relations. \n                The Apollo-Soyuz mission, carried out jointly by Russia and the United States, \n                was an important milestone in easing Cold War tensions. And of course, the \n                International Space Station has allowed astronomers around the world to work \n                together and make advancements no single country could achieve alone.</p>,\n        imageLink: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Apollo_11_liftoff.jpg\",\n        top:\"5%\",\n        left: \"7.8%\",\n        padding: \"2% 3.1%\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 2,\n        found: false,\n        name: <h1>John Harrison’s H4</h1>,\n        details: <p>In 1714, The Longitude Act was signed by the British parliament, providing a \n                 huge reward to anyone who could determine a method to find a ship’s precise \n                 longitude at sea.\n                 <br/>One of the contenders for this prize was John Harrison, a self-taught \n                 clockmaker who journeyed to London in hopes of creating a more accurate way to \n                 tell time, and thus use that time to determine a ship’s longitude. Over 20 years \n                 later, Harrison came up with the H1, which showed great promise in its trials. \n                 Harrison, however, was displeased with his work, and would later go on to develop \n                 the H2 and H3, each more precise than the one before.\n                 <br/>In the 1750s, Harrison came up with the H4, a large pocket watch that was \n                 capable of being used in the sea. H4 was revolutionary in that no pocket watch was \n                 ever considered to be an accurate means of measuring time back then.\n                <br/>Harrison, however, met much opposition throughout his work. The Commissioners \n                in charge of the prize money were skeptical that a self-taught clockmaker who was a \n                carpenter by trade could come up with such a masterpiece well ahead of their time. \n                He also faced a lot of competition from astronomers, who were working to develop \n                their own method of determining longitude by using the stars. Harrison was able to \n                overcome these barriers, however, and would become a source of inspiration for many \n                who wanted to delve into the sciences. </p>,\n        imageLink: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Harrison_H4_chronometer.jpg\",\n        top:\"17.2%\",\n        left: \"37%\",\n        padding: \"2% 1.7%\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 3,\n        found: false,\n        name: <h1>Enola Gay</h1>,\n        details: <p>On August 6th, 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

He realized that in the speeding streetcar, he would see that time would \n                 have stopped on the clock. This realization became an important factor in his paper on a \n                 “special theory of relativity.” He believed that space-time could be affected by mass, \n                 energy, and gravity. These realizations have helped scientists better understand how the \n                 celestial bodies of the universe interact with each other, as well as contribute to the \n                 nuclear age.</p>,\n        imageLink: \"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/05/25/23/47/albert-einstein-784078_960_720.jpg\",\n        top:\"59.5%\",\n        left: \"61.3%\",\n        padding: \"1.5% 2.2%\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 6,\n        found: false,\n        name: <h1>Frankenstein's Monster</h1>,\n        details: <p>While many know of Frankenstein’s monster through popular culture, the original \n                 work <i>Frankenstein</i> written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley puts the famed monster \n                 in a different light.

As a product of the environment around \n                 him, he seeks to show Dr. Frankenstein his anguish after Dr. Frankenstein refuses to create \n                 a female counterpart.<br></br>Shelley was an author in the Romantic era, a period of time in \n                 which many thought of nature and science as mysterious and fantastical, and raised human \n                 concerns to the sciences in hopes to better understand its potential impacts on society.</p>,\n        imageLink: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Frankenstein%27s_monster_%28Boris_Karloff%29.jpg/800px-Frankenstein%27s_monster_%28Boris_Karloff%29.jpg\",\n        top:\"66.6%\",\n        left: \"66.4%\",\n        padding: \"2% 1.3%\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: 7,\n        found: false,\n        name: <h1>Snow's <i>Two Cultures</i></h1>,\n        details: <p>C.P.

This tomato was the first ever genetically engineered \n                 crop to hit the market, and was designed so that it would maintain its ripeness well after the normal \n                 tomato and this gave it a much longer shelf and shipping life. \n                 <br/>These tomatoes, along with subsequent genetically-engineered crops, were still met by a lot of \n                 opposition. One of the most notable shifts in attitude came in August 1998, when Dr. Arpad Pusztai \n                 said that it is possible that feeding rats genetically modified potatoes could lead to health effects \n                 that were a result of genetic engineering. Despite it being proven that the FLAVR SAVR tomato was \n                 similar to regular tomatoes in every way except that its cell walls degraded more slowly, there grew \n                 a general stigma against genetically engineered crops that still stands to this day. </p>,\n        imageLink: \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Tomatoes_ARS.jpg\",\n        top:\"67%\",\n        left: \"35.5%\",\n        padding: \".9% 1.1%\"\n    }\n];\n\nexport default items;","import React from \"react\";\nimport items from \"../items\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport App from \"./App\"\n\n\nfunction Info(props) {\n\n    function goBack(){\n        if(items[props.keyVal].found){\n            ReactDOM.render(<App curItems = {items} numLeft = {props.numLeft}/>, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n        }\n        else {\n            items[props.keyVal].found=true;\n            ReactDOM.render(<App curItems = {items} numLeft = {props.numLeft-1}/>, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n        }\n    }\n    \n    document.body.style=\"background-color: #34656d;\";\n\n    var curItem = items[props.keyVal];\n    var altImage = \"Image of \"+curItem.name;\n    \n    return (\n    <div className=\"info\">\n      <div className=\"image\">\n        <img src={curItem.imageLink} alt={altImage}/>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"details\">\n        <article>\n          {curItem.name}\n          {curItem.details}\n        </article>\n      </div>\n      <button className=\"btn\" onClick={goBack}><i className=\"fas fa-arrow-left\"></i> Back</button>\n    </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Info;","import React from \"react\";\nimport Info from \"./Info\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n\nfunction ItemButton(props) {\n\n    function handleClick(event){\n        var itemsKey = event.target.id;\n        ReactDOM.render(<Info keyVal={itemsKey} numLeft={props.numLeft}/>, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n    }\n    \n    return  (\n        <button className=\"btn\" onClick={handleClick} id={props.index} \n                style={{top: props.top, left:props.left, padding:props.padding, border:(props.isFound ? \".2em solid rgb(216, 21, 21)\":\"none\")}}/>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default ItemButton;","import React from \"react\";\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n    window.location.reload(false);\n}\n\n\nfunction Finish(){\n    document.body.style=\"background-color: #34656d;\";\n    return (\n      <div class=\"start\">\n        <h2>Congrats!
